emotional things i've ever seen inside a sporting stadium every single person inside camp now on their feet holding the banner we see the huge sign saying gracias johan we saw the catalan flag the barcelona flag and the barcelona jersey with number 14 what a beautiful tribute to the
great johan cruyff as you see the starting lineups only caution away for luis suarez but that was at risk in their last league game was able to keep his nose clean and available here today similar story for casa me know in the real madrid starting lineup was the
starting lineups brought to you by soccer calm take a look at the table right now and it is barcelona 76 points atletico winning pocket at 70 real madrid at 66 now again on paper it seems even with the defeat here today barcelona should be able to coast home
but stranger things have happened they can pretty much slam shut any possibility for an atlético real madrid come back here today but they have to get it done first and for real madrid as we head into this moment of silence perhaps a launching pad for the glory to
come the most silent film on cruyff both as a playing legend at a coaching one for barcelona now the sphere says he shook his head and some of them disruptors and it's surprising from section of the fans it seemed to being directly from real madrid fans but it
blaugrana and the all-white of real madrid defending the goal towards the right fill shane alongside ray hudson and glad you could join us it is el clasico there is history to be made or added to 170 second league match between these two and ray 200 in 31st 92
wins for real madrid 90 for barcelona it is hard to separate these two in a rivalry that dates back to the turn of the last century allied on the far side neymar checking back oh for the present felt wonderful look back in time let's think about this game
against bail on the far flake not that many for barcelona other than perhaps the insertion of andres iniesta with a huge match against it let it go on the horizon but for real madrid so many wondering whether zinedine zidane would put in kissimmee dough at the expense of
hummus he has how does that change real madrid well it gives him the balance that everybody's being torn about leading up it's taken the whole while to wake up to the fact that if they're going to start playing with baby say and they're the untouchables you're going to
barcelona will be in support their midfield have got it beautifully choreographed rocket ajikko sketching and yesterboard the fan supporting msn so we'll see samira with a little push in the back but he would get away with it but no alejandro hernández the man in the middle with the
it fully rested and fit benzema and gareth bale not quite the same for barcelona's front three after all the extra emails that they're covered in the south american world could qualify as how much of a difference will lap make we all look sharper than a pin here nice
the fact at his age now 31 in atletico on the horizon probably not a 90-minute stretch for any esta but it is a deep bench or barcelona wasn't always that way this year again alejandro hernández with the whistle it's a tight ball in from messi but he knows
it's sergey busquets arguably the best onetouch player in all of barcelona including the number 10 i was pacing a little bit but again risk and reward as it always is with barcelona stellar season for mr. chiquita this year and he was a bit off the boil last year
messing with the touch up steps morgridge another foul this time against real madrid in the real fractious game hasn't it but with all of the petty fouls in the offs a cause and still barcelona looking up with that score lane thinking that they would be and you may
this year being upstaged by the customer say feel nervous and need him here today by the looks in the opening thirty minutes he'll has lived up to the pressure every time he's been called upon saving the bacon of real madrid over and over every game he'll come up
it was rafa beneath says when these two teams met earlier this season didn't quite work out that well for real madrid he in sports calm there's the chance to share your thoughts on twitter and we would love to hear from you and don't forget hash tag el clasico
3v6 tackle and up steps casa mito oh speaking of stepping up its rockets trotter's he'll pay back in time travis to save real madrid again tremendously my suarez and then it enforced the racket each and then the last thing of a shock this is going out of quit
real madrid and that was iker casillas if it wasn't a costa rican passport you kind of wonder how great people would say novice is his teammates have no doubt that a lie so wonderful stop again a slow-motion doesn't do it justice phil that was sizzled by the kouachi
ronaldo benson man out for cross no one to pass a to care appeal cooking back we're deep and that defensive setup part real madrid and doing well but then when real madrid gain possession and ben's him up gareth not able to make up that space he's usually lives
in but mr decides to go for the strike home she is absolutely the privilege of doing where he's playing has been absolutely superb so far nima also asked from behind almost getting us started back for marcelo barcelona putting pressure on real madrid in their own end outlets almost
it wouldn't have been a contest have you been able to win that ball in he would have been in through on claudio bravo with his piece just throwing into the six outcomes bra or bobbles said he gets there first overs with some space they see gareth bale taking
next decide masha donald xbox left foot parried by bravo cristiano ronaldo playing top-drawer football a 31 year old portuguese they're in again ice from margaret sears canada ha ronaldo in the middle if he can find them sends it across bale benzema flips it into pk trying to clear
full head of steam for gareth bale good one bentham op bail dex maybe maybe but instead its mascherano in the book - tremendous position this one by either gareth or cristiano mascherano comes across with a slate tackle and digs the player not one less of a controversy much
in some ways taking the pressure of the title out these two teams just get a chance to play at rank yep putting your ties from that your age field and look as if the playing with really good abandoned real madrid been defending as best they can with the
three forwards as well keeping this score laying down and starting to creep back into the game now real madrid starting to leave the long grass and coming up and hunting for anything gareth feel on that far say probably more than cristiano on this say they can't see that
it's 264 including the friendlies barcelone a little bit better in those unofficial matches back in the early days 109 wins 296 in la liga play it's 71 for real madrid and 68 for barcelona 32nd minute ticking to a close baker's dozen left to go mr out why tries
a dirty game at all but contentious it has ross - marcella looking long but alba plays it perfectly my solana founded in 1899 real madrid three years later in fact just celebrating their 100 and 14th anniversary at the start of this month and this width here from personal
in league at home against real madrid that was back in 2012 looking for the flick she netted the near post moving in at that near six had it clear by alvez top of the box for named arm would cover kind of a hog all the way back and
doing a pretty good job redesigning this real madrid a far cry from what we saw of the better the bayeux just a few months ago yeah changes lane loops from time to time looking for the right formula it's got a good balance here two deer in reston came
always does himself into the ground but it's the wonderful cerebral clear as well plus he's got the heart the size of a pig i see with only about 40 seconds of added time left rocket ish but it turned left and it looks like keylor navas and claudio bravo
will be able to keep the sheets clean course cool here and he's got two players running in saving the box as always near martin suarez but who is for the top corner well aware coming up to half tame phil get myself into the oxygen attacked in a wonderful
know somebody's going to get sent off and somebody's going to scores the falter looks down let's take a look at the sidelines of the camp nou with another at&t sideline check kevin egan what you got indeed phil i heard andres cordero at the break talked about real madrid
be the goat as plenty of superstars out there to make the difference i think there's going to be a goal or two in this second novel but real madrid who's got the bench it could perhaps make a difference later on in this game as well so when your
game very difficult confusing the real madrid holding three just being pretty much a lot this game awesome you know 120 crossing tote touch by name are again swat has tripped up or hop steps consummate over the phone neymar thanks with his wife back to his left impermissible just
a yard off his life changes things up dropping atomos for mortgage of the flex to go back heel flick by gareth bale this clamps for the offside it's not given but fortunately for barcelona od or bravo hit read it beautifully take a look hit by modric gareth bale
care and he goes kill at this school a wonderful wonderful heather down and dirty he goes he bounces it in like the barnes wallis bomb the demise convention real madrid punished barcelona i've been trying to punish real madrid downstairs but this time they go up but they tries
or after they get past the first clear barcelona insurance policy and defense has been tremendous not what clear concept the mall got each other's backs what response no from seed and then transfer albers shooting a bit more than in recent years not quite back to his sevilla days
we'll pass it off this time gets messy with the goal barcelona be a bit more patient not steal against roma is not the only derby of note the classical hitting spaniard against spaniard or against catalan to check out being sports.com for details the south florida an asl debut
would not expect to see a full 90 from dawn andres but he's still out there atletico madrid the looming around arise and of course maybe a slightly easier tilt real madrid but they will be on the road against wolfsburg i think being your main fill is a top-class
kind of a how to come away with it out of a hob sees it poked away and it's out time now for an at&t sideline check here's kevin egan yes phil and a reminder to go to twitter and vote on our poll should luis suarez i've received a
every set play a free-kick around the goal and also a corner that was not an accident that was purposely by design neymar came across and when all the players were celebrating after bk scored the goal javier mascherano ran across to warn carlos and zuy and congratulated him back
time champions force real madrid with a record 32 almost two slaughters but pepe contorts himself good comeback coming twenty in him there's another look at that bran ball that feigns the pot of gold that is called karim benzema no chance for pikia he stretches his eyebrows to get
horn but was for the placement instead of the power understandably so perhaps but easy pickings for boss a man would build up that from real madrid again him very level very level we response from the royal weights in cristiano still leave his finger prints is this it he's
and his left foot meets a bouncing ball that's a great cover by cassidy arrow would be a corner absolutely i'm soloing up 20 minutes away even from a draw from extending its unbeaten streak to 40 which would tie nottingham forest on the all-time list back in the glory
days of brian clough over the cross novice stays back neymar saying what did i do by the way all-time mark celtic with 62 unbeaten but that was way back in 1915 nothing there till historic for barcelona and they're not done yet join again finding that pocket in the
really bravely taking the game to barcelona leaving themselves high stretched despite the lightning that is waiting up front 73rd minute has stood on hands over his card i just move out seems to have been on that barcelona bench forever don't forget the nasl debut on be in sports
at his barcelona counterpart spinning to the inside dance for alba they say loosening up on the real madrid bench and now looks like we might be seeing a change for the matang gaze you should come off the boil just a bit with his final quarter our deflected but
look they see different animal the content here to place been fitting wonderful goal scorer for real madrid he brought them back into this game gets the caned i trace from the world-class superstar that he was gesu nothing wrong with his performance tonight he had tactically smart as well
all right looks like si actually in the middle is your skits earns the whistle real question now is for real madrid how much do they want to push for a second goal as barcelona looks content to bleed another game off the schedule as he stripped conseguido again si
top of the crossbar real madrid that i'm picking apart barcelona here now a wonderful effort in the release here as a smooth is the back of the spoon from cristiano who gets all his ankles release it is so close city more than anybody down sidelines for another check
bench for real madrid when the goal went in he celebrated with his technical staff with the substitute with everybody and he seemed to be the last person inside camp now that realized that the goal was disallowed it was phenomenal viewing see dan clearly furious afterwards phil thank you
has been you kind of get any better six minutes remain in regulation rey and win lose or draw we will learn a lot over those six minutes about what zinedine zidane has done with real madrid in his brief time seconds earlier they're celebrating a game winner only to
setup from gareth bale family the devane connection occurs right here bliss theodore has drama storm's buzzing about it is funny that belong in a bengal tiger once he gets the service a wonderful run by kava how has he plays it out the wonderful rainbow pass cristianos got a
lot of decisions to make he does it brilliantly superlative again and christian or more sparky than a downed power line here no angle he goes through the way wickets through the legs of claudio bravo but what certainly looks like the match winner now but tame on the clock
still go cristiano ronaldo making that climb up the pichichi chart as not quite the smiles in the barcelona side of the president's box is 29th what a life lane for real madrid still plenty of time on the clock as far as barcelona's concern but messi pickpocketed but phil
ronaldo's face as he turns around three out ready to bleed the clock a bit more lucas vasquez getting set to check in talk about feeding the wind into the seals if as i said at the start this real madrid team coming in on those four wins and had
here today is it enough for real madrid to stick with zinedine zidane for next year we don't know that i don't know and nobody knows other than the president but these are the performances that will keep him in a job nor matter what this is a grid response
the day for 30 seconds to go oh look at that man in black don't forget that man in between the sticks for real madrid deny him look out neymar slips it with the chance but it's casamento in the way and that might do it ronaldo against elvis the
ronaldo goal has given real madrid victory at the capitol and the unbeaten streak is over a branding like this just won la liga this is how much it means to them this was a statement game i said coming in barcelona that's it more than enough to win this
game but they missed their chances and cristiano ronaldo did not smile little late up the stars and eclipse the sun the man of the moment cristiano ronaldo and he was the difference-maker suarez not chopped until he got in front of goal lima was probably the best of the
it stop four games into your super league career and you've won man of the match every time how does it feel to be in the spotlight max power well rob pretty rotten actually and why is that max feel a bit bad taking scar a spot yeah it's not

think england was the second tied for second favorite to win it 20 of 50 rabia actually the top three favorites according to vegas odds were brazil france and england i think england was third after brazil brazil and france had lower odds in england but then england was the
third i think it was like five and a half to one so if you bet 100 you win 550. you get 650 back 20 of 50. and brazil was like four or four and a half to one france was like five to one 28 of 149 raspadori uh
