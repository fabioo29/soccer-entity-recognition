forever girls mothers come past the dangerous wesley sneijder looking done setup as well it's a new yes is best position for the spanish coming into this to survive played for spain it's season just today ocean for this tool i did manage to score 34 goals against it but
this was the anthem wesley sneijder the name is more neutral capital seriousness to us she was getting home too justice the see that championships in 2008 spits this turbulence inside to go times and soon the spanish to see success as per quarter shipping attack oh jim well again
the ball pretty well have been seven shots in all four displayed three for the netherlands at all three for the netherlands have been on target most notably a terrific game and so much to enjoy so far so much movement of passion and color and the pitch they're worried
it stops it sort of spain really did men spain couldn't get out the way they normally like to a great example of that is the long passes that they had to play early on this time it shall be alone zone totally when normally you'd live to get into
to spain to go in and come out like the like to again it speaker helix name it's easy for the ditch things working back shortcuts this to spain 93% accuracy when you allow that water passes stan cut by a third six to two percent it was really working
what we've done percy was absolutely outstanding so hoping that percy's equalizer has teed up this game quite wonderfully those dutch fans would have been just a little bit bother got their big day ahead of learn a couple of difficult looking group games against chile and australia but they
16 for the team that finishes second in this group and if the netherlands beat spain here and even if they get a draw when it is in the balance as to whether who knows the world champions could play the tournament favorites and hosts in the last 16 of
their history back in barcelona in 1987 that was a suggest today because very quickly ten status is raining very hard martin's ending spain yes there have been gained four years ago against switzerland the first to file itself every jealous against this dutch since it's this to me today
at self-esteem amazing amazing manchester united fans are pretty happy at the moment as well masterminded by their new manager and they might just have to wait a little longer than many had suspected before he can take over words to tell you the incredible thing was that judge to
mingle down exactly the attack and then dismissive dennis okay finish the second robin made it to the five three one four one three van persie robert made it five one it's day spain spain dominated possession in a way that tells the story because they do a dominate possession
and sometimes they don't make enough of it and playing it wonderfully typically as well netherlands too good you don't see many games whether the same neighborhood predicts big six against mine here's how the table looks in spain at chile coming up not be easy of course netherlands that
vionnet landed on the earth come come not with glabra said yet all the classrooms circuiting understand and removed a home for the nutella masala at this s fantastic signed reprinted or that's the really died i'm walking away in france in italy was had moment from the rest right
sets of players ready to take the field wembley stadium in terms of the seats is not jam-packed yet but it will be by kickoff and we understand there could be a record attendance in place today since wibbly was rebuilt at the turn of the millennium martin atkinson you
to nilda chelsea the ball blocked on the line but a goal was given remember those were the days before goal line technology chelsea wanted to score another three of course but that had a huge bearing on the way that the game was played out a huge gang it
been a lot of talk about the chelsea line of all day and the most well ward rumors have proved to be true who take acosta no eden hazard the team shows five changes from last weekend at manchester united thibaut courtois back a girl after illness markers alonso likewise
on the left starts for william batch ye back a picked ahead of john terry to be the replacement for the unwell gary cahill yeah now k only having played two fa cups i seats coming back from that loner form of alongside luiz and astral equator in the back
for me that's why what can he do liberty chances this season big semi-final appearance for him totems team has also been taught to ban plenty with maritza upon tino going with the 3/4 reformation that was successful against chelsea in january kieran trippier comes in for karl warped on
the right has his bent away all cobra and to accommodate the informs on into the system hill on the left of the midfield for a in place of ben davis yes the system used by a boy richie okada gino in that victory against first so i think that's
the chinese super league and before we start today we will observe a minute's applause in tribute to the former aston villa middlesbrough and england defender who go away on spurs under 23 coach i'm sure you'll be aware tragically suddenly collapsed and died with a suspected heart attack in
feel powering presents so many here as a teammate of the england manager gareth southgate at aston villa and at middlesbrough mr. stanley really missing it chelsea against tottenham hotspur for a place in the 2017 emirates fa cup final it doesn't get much better than this blast on the
different surface it's softer it's not as quick and slick as that they week in week out christian eriksen with the corner won't bother with the surface for this one floated into alder viral who only just missed it losses carried it away to cook fan petra and soul daddy
case but for that's to quinton's for the day for chelsea captain this season through that with the stomach bug every day erichs really good challenge perpetua tato spurs trying to catch him he is caught and the decision is a foul and a free-kick toby alderweireld just outside the
side of a three for three told me come his way now bye over top he's been in down the middle 40 goals thibaut courtois and the question would always be because he has been in scintillating goals going for mary-kate women take back sister beginning his contact got across
turning to chelsea from bob earth when he getting regular getting hominid dressing you can see why chelsea want to be back when needed ready to perform to this point he stepped up to the and strong physical with very violent moses - let me have top number got lucky
it just helps in our corner only possible way filled with so ch3 cave scouring all manner of goes that's my chassis well tottenham hotspur it's such a difficult chelsey without 26 guns this season so expensive that really was just like tomato just let's clean again it's doing that
spectacular one you just felt the psychic attack what search was this is held up by victor moses the cells in my world so it's a big teased ali ali it was clear but that luis who is that for it's not gotta tempt fate another brazilian get his chance
yet christian eriksen spurs on two plotting yet defend assyrian he does so basically they're gonna be instruction to do that signaling for that bone to be played out what's up all right sir just stands on his right ankle you see him stretching for the ball books show that
of their squads that there masen yeah two of the top teams for a number of years to come up short we'll be seeing them here a lot at wembley spurs expected to be here next season and maybe chelsea to follow them as tenants when work begins at stamford
bridge defense tech to kindly on both sides to all the seats big river towards erickson as conte luta pachu i conte as an option in moses right miss victor moses and sun didn't quite get that right was that in or out it was end it's a chelsea penalty
he and hosting the assistant was the man who waved his flag solace finding the defensive side of that left-hand side roll in a three for three difficult well guy he goes to her he goes to ground too early victor moses he just slides the ball past him with
his first touch and then you can see he rides the challenge is the assistant that wakes up martine agencies why he comes across he just goes underneath victor moses is a silly challenger in song and in eventually marty natesan certainly working with his assistant has given the penalty
looking at the roof i don't think there's an argument clever from moses from sun hookman he's a forward to make the challenge to earlier moses was clambering lockable passing through the challenge already schooled me within the skirt to chelsea after later gator wembley chelsea - chuckling whoa josie
cup semi-finals so far between chelsea and tottenham hotspur it's your party no unhappy at being behind at the breakin engaged in conversation with fourth official neal swarbrick to suitably but the award of a penalty which put it to one to chelsea it's probably saying that there was no
context folk songs challenge but for the sony's health control that challenge as soon as he lays down arguments changes by overhead coach the beginning of the second half it's chelsea who get things going again can we see some looks for victor moses which means jill with something at
danny rose sustained he's made some point henry caine man he was found smurfs on a free-kick he's not gonna let him progress from there for the run of sod his head around but a further away from cake of your picture of the team's changez weekend event is tonight
the boss spurs corner coming clever - countess holy matty top as it was thrown suppose two girls against chelsea january term eriksen process i stopped so not quite as flowing and exciting in the early minutes in the second half this little page here it is yeah chelsea have
game like this all right so last may end of the season the battle of stamford bridge more got a little out of hand between these two petrol is just too sharp in front of one you are traveling nice message first to alonso this plot plus the story terms
of changes antonio first - in question my son mr. donatelli ah he chased by us to the quittin can you find erickson christian eriksen torvik to mines it was a difficult all court throws himself at it the far side as a lonesome expensive ball all the way from
going to revert to something more like the team were used to seeing kyle walker is going to come on i walk in here to play any part in this season's fa cup run automatic choice of app regularly well we solu goes off and possibly change to the left
and then maybe another half an hour that said if it does go to another half an hour they could use another sub that you i can do it for the rest of the 90 anyway cesc fàbregas on for petrol former arsenal pirate never chelsea fire against the reception
as close as they feed to the squirrels go aloha - taller picante blues he's tried to get that he's hayden assad he found a way through it's the blues who strike the next sucker punch miss bus well chelsea attack chelsea three boys two guys have first strike on
semi-final that's a goal that the mannion message would have dreamed up he could not have hit that any more sweetly we just did not stop that unreachable unstoppable the manny mattos never scored a goal for chelsea at stamford bridge he's got one of the best they've ever scored
at wembley chelsea for tottenham hotspur two who picks first regas as whatever reason just talk to white simple needs pictures into surrendering this you would not expect many many years of watching football any antonio let's go as a coach or as a plan to fill that he was
getting towards the end of a if you're going to score your first goal of the season save it for something really really special look at good zoom and look at john terry faces of disbelief we to us art who's on side he's bigler race talk back there alonso
when these teams met in the premier league at the end of last season because there as he played the ball away he mused on his experience you can save on a facial expressions emerged this guy who started male that's up it's very supportive fàbregas diego costa that's how
it's paid for headed recent games players be torn out position as if joseph classical's in all sorts of problems we disjointed across the with his first child city gave edge white erichs erikson is it cooter that's victor moses puts the brakes on at the right side what a
as at the moment england's leading football club that seemed to be and now dele alec gets new is foul free picks purse two minutes of injury time played the board said four so at least two more to go hurricane is not letting christian eriksen have a look in
an opponent from thibaut courtois put the braixen there's a relief chelsea go deeper coach tony accommodate five years this afternoon that's up poets of ericsson fàbregas matich what is it about this stadium that just brings out the great goals in place tom's david luiz and kudos that is
face either manchester city our arsenal in a final that could be want to sabre to blue is the color of wounding today chelsea floor shot them too you so why do i think i'm the ultimate super strikers fan this is why oh oh this is why my scarf
invincible united on the other hand are a well-oiled machine oh so close oh you want this ah sorry miss fran i have to get a message to shakes invincible united states not a gear buy it here nowhere else to get your gear you're not a real fan unless
was one of the most emotional things i've ever seen inside a sporting stadium every single person inside camp now on their feet holding the banner we see the huge sign saying gracias johan we saw the catalan flag the barcelona flag and the barcelona jersey with number 14 what
a beautiful tribute to the great johan cruyff as you see the starting lineups only caution away for luis suarez but that was at risk in their last league game was able to keep his nose clean and available here today similar story for casa me know in the real
madrid starting lineup was the starting lineups brought to you by soccer calm take a look at the table right now and it is barcelona 76 points atletico winning pocket at 70 real madrid at 66 now again on paper it seems even with the defeat here today barcelona should
be able to coast home but stranger things have happened they can pretty much slam shut any possibility for an atlético real madrid come back here today but they have to get it done first and for real madrid as we head into this moment of silence perhaps a launching
real madrid fans but it doesn't matter or drowned out by the field assessing wonderful tribute and now let's get ready to rock and roll these two footballing teams exemplify in the spirit of the football that grace displayed in different ways perhaps but world-class footballers again we are under
away barcelona in their familiar blaugrana and the all-white of real madrid defending the goal towards the right fill shane alongside ray hudson and glad you could join us it is el clasico there is history to be made or added to 170 second league match between these two and
ray 200 in 31st 92 wins for real madrid 90 for barcelona it is hard to separate these two in a rivalry that dates back to the turn of the last century allied on the far side neymar checking back oh for the present felt wonderful look back in time
we see an offside flag against bail on the far flake not that many for barcelona other than perhaps the insertion of andres iniesta with a huge match against it let it go on the horizon but for real madrid so many wondering whether zinedine zidane would put in kissimmee
dough at the expense of hummus he has how does that change real madrid well it gives him the balance that everybody's being torn about leading up it's taken the whole while to wake up to the fact that if they're going to start playing with baby say and they're
know that this midfield of barcelona will be in support their midfield have got it beautifully choreographed rocket ajikko sketching and yesterboard the fan supporting msn so we'll see samira with a little push in the back but he would get away with it but no alejandro hernández the man
course has the benefit of it fully rested and fit benzema and gareth bale not quite the same for barcelona's front three after all the extra emails that they're covered in the south american world could qualify as how much of a difference will lap make we all look sharper
stepping up here's iniesta again the fact at his age now 31 in atletico on the horizon probably not a 90-minute stretch for any esta but it is a deep bench or barcelona wasn't always that way this year again alejandro hernández with the whistle it's a tight ball in
from messi but he knows it's sergey busquets arguably the best onetouch player in all of barcelona including the number 10 i was pacing a little bit but again risk and reward as it always is with barcelona stellar season for mr. chiquita this year and he was a bit
off the boil last year messing with the touch up steps morgridge another foul this time against real madrid in the real fractious game hasn't it but with all of the petty fouls in the offs a cause and still barcelona looking up with that score lane thinking that they
international but even his brilliance this year being upstaged by the customer say feel nervous and need him here today by the looks in the opening thirty minutes he'll has lived up to the pressure every time he's been called upon saving the bacon of real madrid over and over
playing side of this course it was rafa beneath says when these two teams met earlier this season didn't quite work out that well for real madrid he in sports calm there's the chance to share your thoughts on twitter and we would love to hear from you and don't
says the referee now it's 3v6 tackle and up steps casa mito oh speaking of stepping up its rockets trotter's he'll pay back in time travis to save real madrid again tremendously my suarez and then it enforced the racket each and then the last thing of a shock this
patrol the nets here for real madrid and that was iker casillas if it wasn't a costa rican passport you kind of wonder how great people would say novice is his teammates have no doubt that a lie so wonderful stop again a slow-motion doesn't do it justice phil that
steps ramos strong stepping by ronaldo benson man out for cross no one to pass a to care appeal cooking back we're deep and that defensive setup part real madrid and doing well but then when real madrid gain possession and ben's him up gareth not able to make up
for the third pass coming in but mr decides to go for the strike home she is absolutely the privilege of doing where he's playing has been absolutely superb so far nima also asked from behind almost getting us started back for marcelo barcelona putting pressure on real madrid in
was one-on-one with alba and it wouldn't have been a contest have you been able to win that ball in he would have been in through on claudio bravo with his piece just throwing into the six outcomes bra or bobbles said he gets there first overs with some space
they see gareth bale taking the moisture off that summer with the touch but it straight to swaddles his pass may be deflected behind messi his marcello's intervention rather than a clear pass good covering from the x flume on greevey three messy and they might have a shower the
middle he can find him next decide masha donald xbox left foot parried by bravo cristiano ronaldo playing top-drawer football a 31 year old portuguese they're in again ice from margaret sears canada ha ronaldo in the middle if he can find them sends it across bale benzema flips it
an outlet and it's a full head of steam for gareth bale good one bentham op bail dex maybe maybe but instead its mascherano in the book - tremendous position this one by either gareth or cristiano mascherano comes across with a slate tackle and digs the player not one
eight games left to go in some ways taking the pressure of the title out these two teams just get a chance to play at rank yep putting your ties from that your age field and look as if the playing with really good abandoned real madrid been defending as
best they can with the three forwards as well keeping this score laying down and starting to creep back into the game now real madrid starting to leave the long grass and coming up and hunting for anything gareth feel on that far say probably more than cristiano on this
all-time matches between these two it's 264 including the friendlies barcelone a little bit better in those unofficial matches back in the early days 109 wins 296 in la liga play it's 71 for real madrid and 68 for barcelona 32nd minute ticking to a close baker's dozen left to
in this split hasn't been a dirty game at all but contentious it has ross - marcella looking long but alba plays it perfectly my solana founded in 1899 real madrid three years later in fact just celebrating their 100 and 14th anniversary at the start of this month and
one of their last seven in league at home against real madrid that was back in 2012 looking for the flick she netted the near post moving in at that near six had it clear by alvez top of the box for named arm would cover kind of a hog
redesign volkswagen passat nadine zidane doing a pretty good job redesigning this real madrid a far cry from what we saw of the better the bayeux just a few months ago yeah changes lane loops from time to time looking for the right formula it's got a good balance here
keylor navas and claudio bravo will be able to keep the sheets clean course cool here and he's got two players running in saving the box as always near martin suarez but who is for the top corner well aware coming up to half tame phil get myself into the
something's going to give you know somebody's going to get sent off and somebody's going to scores the falter looks down let's take a look at the sidelines of the camp nou with another at&t sideline check kevin egan what you got indeed phil i heard andres cordero at the
break talked about real madrid potentially playing with fire and looking at the body language of zinedine zidane throughout the first half he obviously doesn't think so he remains quite emotionless the only time zhi zhu has gotten quite active with his emotions was when pepe needlessly gave the ball
be the hero who will be the goat as plenty of superstars out there to make the difference i think there's going to be a goal or two in this second novel but real madrid who's got the bench it could perhaps make a difference later on in this game
been going on throughout this game very difficult confusing the real madrid holding three just being pretty much a lot this game awesome you know 120 crossing tote touch by name are again swat has tripped up or hop steps consummate over the phone neymar thanks with his wife back
again another inner swinger bravo a yard off his life changes things up dropping atomos for mortgage of the flex to go back heel flick by gareth bale this clamps for the offside it's not given but fortunately for barcelona od or bravo hit read it beautifully take a look
hit by modric gareth bale in an offside position for sure but watch the ibaka dabra it's a good effort by gareth even though he is off step and he has to wanted it more it is messy 499 career goals to the turn they had the space behind and
and out they get good care and he goes kill at this school a wonderful wonderful heather down and dirty he goes he bounces it in like the barnes wallis bomb the demise convention real madrid punished barcelona i've been trying to punish real madrid downstairs but this time they
back to his sevilla days we'll pass it off this time gets messy with the goal barcelona be a bit more patient not steal against roma is not the only derby of note the classical hitting spaniard against spaniard or against catalan to check out being sports.com for details the
it dispossessed albert iniesta that would not expect to see a full 90 from dawn andres but he's still out there atletico madrid the looming around arise and of course maybe a slightly easier tilt real madrid but they will be on the road against wolfsburg i think being your
luis suarez i've received a red card for the elbow on pepe earlier in the match do get your vote in there and a quick thought on the barcelona corner go from pk the assistant coach luis enriquez assistant coaches name is juan carlos moon zuy he steps up in
place of luis enrique for every set play a free-kick around the goal and also a corner that was not an accident that was purposely by design neymar came across and when all the players were celebrating after bk scored the goal javier mascherano ran across to warn carlos and
a title marcille ona 23 time champions force real madrid with a record 32 almost two slaughters but pepe contorts himself good comeback coming twenty in him there's another look at that bran ball that feigns the pot of gold that is called karim benzema no chance for pikia he
that and sizzled that one horn but was for the placement instead of the power understandably so perhaps but easy pickings for boss a man would build up that from real madrid again him very level very level we response from the royal weights in cristiano still leave his finger
by messi to feign suarez and his left foot meets a bouncing ball that's a great cover by cassidy arrow would be a corner absolutely i'm soloing up 20 minutes away even from a draw from extending its unbeaten streak to 40 which would tie nottingham forest on the all-time
