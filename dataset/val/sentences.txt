gonna break thursday friday so i hopefully i should be able to get it done kessie same one again ac milan there's a hobby yeah i mean on paper i think england on paper is better than france like if you go position by position and compare them 19 of
75. france has ambape okay that's great but you know i mean harry kane isn't a slouch either and england's got so much more depth in my opinion like top to bottom but i could be wrong although i don't know i mean i'm kind of biased because i'm a
germany i was looking at teams that could surprise 59 of 105 brobe dybala yeah once you get to the world cup germany it's like they're just they turn it on nine of 12. i'm really excited about the group the u.s group sorry i just hope well i mean
